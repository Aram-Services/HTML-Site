    <h1>Hello, today we will talk about some science projects you could do. </h1>
    <p>Lets Start with the ceramic bowl science project!!!<br></p>
  <h5>Materials:<br>
    Dry Erase Marker<br>
    Ceramic Bowl<br>
    Cold Tap Water<br>
   <br>
    Lets Start The project!!!!!<br>
    Now go ahead and get the ceramic bowl and you write inside of it. <br>
    Then SLOWLY pour cold tap water inside. Whatever you drew with the dry erase marker will slowly lift of of the surface and it will be awesome!!!!!<br>
    Now that is the end of our projects</p>
